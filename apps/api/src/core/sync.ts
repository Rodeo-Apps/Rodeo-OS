/**
 * Offline sync and the arena authority model.
 *
 * Architecture ref: §4.4.
 *
 * A secretary's laptop in a rural arena loses connectivity for hours. It keeps
 * taking scores. So does the judge's tablet, and the timer bridge. When the
 * link comes back, three devices have opinions about the same run and somebody
 * has to be right.
 *
 * The rule is authority, not recency: hardware beats a person, the secretary's
 * terminal beats other people, and contestant records come from the server
 * because entries were reconciled with PROCOM there. A last-write-wins clock
 * comparison would let a judge's stale tablet overwrite a hardware time.
