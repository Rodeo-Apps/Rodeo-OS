/**
 * Money actually moving.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE ARENA REALITY
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A platform that can only pay by card cannot run a jackpot. At a Saturday
 * roping the secretary pays out of a cash box, or writes checks at the desk,
 * and the winners leave with money in their pocket before anybody's bank has
 * heard about it. At the NFR it goes out by transfer weeks later.
 *
 * So settlement is a STATE MACHINE over the ledger, not a Stripe wrapper. Every
 * payment method — card, ACH, cash, check, account credit — moves a ledger row
 * through the same states and leaves the same audit trail. Stripe is one
 * implementation of "the money left"; a secretary counting twenties is another,
 * and the ledger cannot tell the difference afterwards. That is the point.
 *
 * The ledger row itself is immutable (delta D9). Status lives in
 * `transaction_status_events`, appended one row per transition, so the history
 * of a payment is the history — not a column that was overwritten.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
