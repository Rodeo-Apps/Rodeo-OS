/**
 * Platform pricing.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THIS IS IN THE ENGINE AND NOT A SPREADSHEET
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The platform fee is money a contestant pays. It appears on the entry
 * confirmation, it has to reconcile against the ledger, and it has to be
 * identical every time it is quoted. That makes it the same class of thing as
 * a payout split, not a marketing number — so it lives next to the payout
 * engine, in integer cents, with tests.
 *
 * It also means the business model is executable. Changing the take rate is a
 * config change with a test suite behind it, and the revenue model in
 * docs/PRICING.md is computed by the same code that charges the fee.
