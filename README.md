# RodeoApps.pro OS

The operating system for producing a rodeo. Entries, draw, scoring, results,
payouts, waivers and settlement — for the producer, the secretary, the judge,
the timer operator, the stock contractor and the contestant, on one platform.

Built from *RodeoApps.pro OS — Complete Technical Architecture v1.0*
(17 June 2026). Where this repository departs from that document it does so on
purpose, and every departure is written down in
[`docs/SPEC-DELTAS.md`](docs/SPEC-DELTAS.md) with the reason. **Read that file
before assuming the code is wrong.** Forty defects are recorded; several
of them lose money, leak data, or deadlock a rodeo one step from done.

Rules were last reviewed against published sources on **8 August 2026** —
what is sourced, what is not, and where each value came from is in
[`docs/RULES.md`](docs/RULES.md).

The product model — Procore for construction, Toast for restaurants, applied
to rodeo — and what it demanded of the schema is in
[`docs/MODEL.md`](docs/MODEL.md).

[`docs/PRICING.md`](docs/PRICING.md) sets out the business model — a tiered
producer subscription from free to $299/mo, Stripe at cost, and nothing taken
on the money flow — with the competitor
rates it was set against. The numbers are computed by the engine, not typed
into a table.

**[`docs/AUDIT.md`](docs/AUDIT.md) walks four real rodeos end to end** — the
NFR in Las Vegas, Cheyenne Frontier Days, a local Texas rodeo and an Oklahoma
jackpot — with what passed, what broke, and what is still missing.

### The engine is the important part

`packages/engine` is where a bug costs somebody real money, so it is isolated:
pure functions over configuration data, no database, no network, no clock, no
randomness. That makes it exhaustively testable, and it means the same code
runs on the server, in the secretary's browser, and offline in an arena with no
signal.

Two properties it holds:

- **Every rule is data.** Increments, variance caps, judge counts, penalty
  tables, payout ladders, ground-money behaviour, handicap division caps — all
  loaded from `scoring_configs`, `payout_configs` and `division_templates`. A
  sanctioning body changing a rule mid-season is a new config row, never a
  deploy. PBR moving to tenth-point marking for 2026 was a data change.
- **Every option is data too.** 48 event types, 34 arena roles, 25 fee types,
  24 sanctioning bodies and thirteen more domains live in `reference_options`,
  and a producer adds their own without a migration. A ranch rodeo running
  wild cow milking, or a playday running a keyhole race, does not need us.
- **Money reconciles exactly.** All amounts are integer cents and every split
  is a largest-remainder allocation over the whole pool. The sum of the payout
  lines equals the net purse, to the cent, always. The API refuses to serve a
  calculation that does not balance.

```
$ cd packages/engine && node --test "test/*.test.ts"
# tests 291
# pass 291
# fail 0

$ cd apps/api && TEST_DATABASE_URL=... node --test "test/*.test.ts"
# tests 168
# pass 168
# fail 0
```

No `npm install` needed to run them — that is deliberate.

## Stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| API | Fastify 5.11 on Node 24 LTS, TypeScript 6 strict |
| Database | PostgreSQL 16 on Supabase, row-level security |
| Auth | Supabase Auth (JWT), roles via `org_members` |
| Payments | Stripe Connect |
| Data access | postgres.js, RLS-bound per request (see delta D25) |
| Realtime | WebSockets for arena terminals, SSE for spectators |
| Offline | PWA + IndexedDB, authority-based sync reconciliation |
| Hosting | Vercel (web), Fly.io (API), Supabase (data) |

Per Appendix A of the architecture. The one substantive change is how tenant
isolation is enforced — see delta D1.

## Running it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PrivacyKeeper/Rodeo-OS
cd Rodeo-OS
cp .env.example .env      # fill in Supabase and Stripe keys

# engines — no install required
cd packages/engine && node --test "test/*.test.ts"

# schema
supabase db push          # or: psql -f supabase/migrations/*.sql in order

# local Postgres instead of Supabase? add the auth primitives first
psql -f supabase/local/bootstrap.sql
for f in supabase/migrations/*.sql; do psql -f "$f"; done
psql -f supabase/local/bootstrap.sql   # again, for grants on new tables

# API
npm install
npm run dev --workspace @rodeo-os/api

# Secretary interface — no install, no build
npm run dev --workspace @rodeo-os/web    # http://localhost:5173

# integration tests against a real database with RLS on
cd apps/api
TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgres://... node --test "test/*.test.ts"
```

Requires Node 24 LTS (Active LTS until 20 October 2026). Native TypeScript
type stripping means the engine runs without a build step.

## Multi-tenancy in one paragraph

Every tenant-scoped table carries `org_id`. RLS policies derive the caller's
tenant from `auth.uid()` — signed into the JWT by Supabase Auth and not
settable by a client — joined through `org_members`. Child tables declare
*composite* foreign keys on `(org_id, parent_id)` so a row in one tenant
physically cannot reference a row in another. The financial ledger and signed
waivers are append-only, enforced by triggers rather than policies, because
triggers bind the service role too. Full reasoning in
[`docs/SECURITY.md`](docs/SECURITY.md).

| Year-end | Complete — earnings by person against the threshold in force. Files nothing, by design |
| Secretary interface | **Runs a rodeo end to end** — setup, entries, draw, day sheet, scoring, payouts, books, sanctioning, releases, grounds, year-end |
| Supabase Auth in the UI | Not wired — token pasted in Settings |
| Offline PWA | Built on this branch — rodeo packet and queue in IndexedDB (`apps/web/public/js/offline.js`), hand-written service worker (`apps/web/public/sw.js`), engine served to the browser by `apps/web/server.ts` |
| Timer Bridge | Not started |

Every request opens a transaction carrying the caller's verified JWT claims and
`set local role authenticated`, so RLS — not application code — decides what
each request can see. The integration suite proves it by running **as real
users**: a superuser bypasses RLS, so a test that passes as `postgres` proves
nothing about whether one producer can read another's entries.

Build order and what comes next: [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md).

## The four things this is organised around

**One.** The books close before the trailer leaves. A sanctioned rodeo has a
wall-clock filing deadline with a fine on it, and the secretary is alone in an
arena office at ten at night reconciling a payoff by hand. `checkBooks()` tells
her exactly what is still wrong — naming the contestant and the fix, not "3
issues found" — and nothing that is merely paperwork is ever allowed to stop
her filing.

**Two.** An association is a row, not a code path. Rules, event list, filing
deadline, deduction basis, required credentials and compliance calendar all
live in `associations` and `association_requirements`. Adding a state
association is data entry. When breakaway roping was added to professional
rodeo, the incumbent central system had trouble because it was not built to
take another event; here that is one row.

**Three.** A jackpot is never asked a question a jackpot cannot answer. The
compliance layer hangs off sanctioning, so a rodeo nobody sanctions generates
an empty checklist, has no deadline, no deduction and no credential
requirements — and the interface hides the section entirely. There is an
invariant asserting the open profile carries no requirements at all.

**Four.** A run belongs to the person who made it. `career_runs` is global:
one person, one animal, one record, across every organisation and every
association — including rodeos that never ran on this platform, imported and
labelled as such. No cowboy in America can currently see everything they have
won this year in one place, and that is the fragmentation an event-shaped
product cannot fix.

## Relationship to the discipline apps

RodeoApps.pro OS is the platform. The discipline apps —
[barrelconnect.pro](https://barrelconnect.pro),
[bullrider.pro](https://bullrider.pro),
[breakawayroping.pro](https://breakawayroping.pro),
[teamrope.pro](https://teamrope.pro),
[tiedown.pro](https://tiedown.pro),
[saddlebronc.pro](https://saddlebronc.pro),
[barebackbronc.pro](https://barebackbronc.pro),
[bulldogging.pro](https://bulldogging.pro),
[ranchrodeo.pro](https://ranchrodeo.pro) — are vertical extensions on top of it
(§3.2, §3.3.3). They deploy separately and share the database, reading the
rodeos, entries and scores for their own event type through the same RLS
policies. A contestant's profile, memberships and winnings exist once, across
all of them.
